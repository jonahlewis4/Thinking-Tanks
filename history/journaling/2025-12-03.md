The first goal of today is to take the addresses I've gathered so far, 
and create a simple program that lets me view the values at those addresses. 
Potentially, I could also write to those addresses.
This will involve using the dolphin API to read/write memory.

I also need to figure out some sort of GUI.
After doing some research, I will attempt to use Electron with a bundled python backend.

I managed to get an electron app running. It has a python subprocess, so tomorrow I'll
look into how to communicate between the two.
