Today I managed to get a working backend websocket server, as well
as a frontend that reads from the websocket.

Up next, there's a lot of refactoring and cleaning up that I'd like
to do before I start adding more features.

I managed to do some nice refactoring of the code. I'm pretty happy
with the result. There is now a react frontend and python backend. 
The backend uses a websocket to send updates every second. Right now
there is just a counter app that's been implemented. 

My next step is to create a python class that fetches data from dolphin.
