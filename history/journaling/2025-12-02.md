I've decided to make this project.
The general idea is to create a program that can play Wii Play Tanks.

Some decisions I've made so far:
* Use dolphin as the emulator
* I want to read memory from the emulator to read the game state
* I will use the game state to decide what moves the player should make

Part of the reason I want to read from memory is because of the randomness 
involved with the game. Enemy tanks move randomly, and after level 20, Levels
which are not multiples of 5 are randomly generated. Thus, basic reinforcement learning 
on tank input is not possible. To get around this, I will read the game state and 
decide what moves to make based on details like incoming bullets and enemy tank locations.

I need to figure out more in depth what kind of behavior I want to program
the tank to do, but for now the primary focus is to determine if it
is even possible to determine the game state from memory.

I need to determine the following info from wii memory:
1. player tank location
2. enemy tank locations
3. incoming bullet locations and directions
4. possibly enemy tank colors
5. possibly the tank that originated each live bullet
6. if 5 is not possible, I would need to manually track player bullet reserves.

To start out, I've already installed dolphin.
Next, I need to unlock the tank minigame

Problems I encountered today:
Positions are stored as floats. Determining data type is difficult.
